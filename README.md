# worktime-tracker
Tracks time I spend in the office.

I come to office, press a button on my smartphone through IFTTT DO Button that sends request to this app which is a simple webhook for IFTTT. Incoming request is written to the database. Same happens when I leave. So I don't have to track my overtime and undertime each day.
